    "des": "My name is Dmitry Zelenko. For many years I have been a computer scientist developing artificial intelligence technologies. Now it is a smaller part of my life, and I spend most of my time as a yogi, a dancer, and a world traveller. SpandaWorks is a site of my reflections on life as I am going through this major transition. 'Spanda' is a sacred Sanskrit word meaning the original impulse of creation, love, and beauty in all living things."
