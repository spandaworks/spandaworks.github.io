Finding God in Life...

I can replace the word "God" with "Beauty" or "Truth" or "Love". All of them point to the same ineffable domain, where our logic fails and our soul flies. And I do not seek to fly from life, instead I want to embrace life, to find God in every leaf of summer grass, in every smile of a friend, in the deep breath of my beloved sleeping nearby.


My spiritual awakening happened about seven years ago. The Universe graced me with a tremendous opening that transformed me overnight from a somber atheist into a full-blown mystic. After that I spent several years just floating by being mostly drenched in bliss. And yet my body and psyche needed healing. However deep the opening was, I needed a lot of work to understand and integrate it into my life. I resisted that work. I deemed myself almost enlightened, walking close to God, for I just needed to close my eyes and be overwhelmed by divine orgasmic energies rushing through my body, immersing me in sweet states of ecstasy.


And so I was floating by, and it is only through connection with others, especially, sexual connections that I started seeing more and more that I needed healing. My sexuality needed healing. My personality was in a tender state when old damaging patterns and new deep insights were mixing together. Sometimes I could see the world like a buddha. And sometimes I could behave like a neurotic teenager. While God can grace us with a glimpse of Truth, it is our responsibility to transform the divine spark into the all-consuming flame that will destroy everything that stands between us and the Divine.


For healing and transformation, I chose the path of Tantra. Or, more precisely, the path of Tantra chose me. For it is through Tantra I first tasted the Divine, and it is through Tantra that I needed to travel the journey of healing and purification. And Tantra is the path of total acceptance of life, of embracing life as a vehicle for enlightenment, or using every single aspect of existence as a tool for opening and growth.


Tantra led me on a journey around the world. Even before leaving my comfortable life in Washington, DC, for two years I was spending months delving deeper into Tantra, traveling to Tantra retreats and festivals, taking workshops and trainings. One step forward, two steps backward: a Tantra path is never linear. It is a wild spiral that with every turn requires us to shed more layers of what we are not, to look honestly at the murky parts of ourselves that keep us from seeing God.


Finally, last year not only did I see that my life in Washington, DC was out of alignment with my deeper truth, but also I had enough courage to act on that understanding. I left my old life, got rid of all my possessions, and went on a road, traveling around the world, meditating on the next phase of my life. I spent the last five months in India, some time on the path of Tantra, and some time on my own, seeking for clarity, praying for deeper trust in the journey.


Outlines of the shores of the new phase of my life are slowly appearing in the distance. In less than a month I will start the two year long process of Tantra Teacher Training with [Ma Ananda Sarita](http://tantra-essence.com), an amazing Tantra master. It is the path of Osho Tantra that blends variety of therapies with deep meditations and rituals. It is the path that celebrates sexuality and feelings, uses them as fuel for healing, transformation, and enlightenment. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to receive the transmission of Ma Sarita.


In September I will also return to the town of Mazunte on the Pacific coast of Mexico for a three month long Teacher Training at [Hridaya yoga](http://hridaya-yoga.com), the deep and beautiful yoga school, with my dear master Sahajananda. I have been practicing Hridaya yoga and meditation for the last two years, and with every breath, with every question "Who am I?" my consciousness grew and my heart opened more and more. It is an intense yogic sadhana that emphasizes Consciousness and perfectly complements the Energy-rich path of Osho Tantra. I see the two of them as forming a complete mandala of Life, with Consciousness and Energy, Shiva and Shakti united in a Tantric embrace.


And so I come back to my Life, to this single moment of my Life, tasting it, dissolving in it, for there is nothing else but this very moment...
