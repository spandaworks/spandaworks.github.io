My journey into yoga started almost 10 years ago. I was recovering from a serious knee surgery, and my ex-wife presented me with a gift certificate for a semester of Iyengar yoga. She had practiced Iyengar yoga for several years and wanted to introduce me to the practice, taking the knee rehabilitation process as an excellent opportunity. Reluctantly, I complied and started coming once a week to an Iyengar yoga studio.


Fast-forward to 2016, and yoga is now at the center of my life. But it is not the yoga that most people in the west are familiar with. A postural practice for stretching and strengthening the body - this is what most Westerners associate with the word "yoga". This is an excellent starting point, but just a starting point. Over the last 10 years my understanding of yoga grew, and with every new insight I marveled at the depth and power of the tradition.


So what is yoga?


Yoga is a system, a discipline, a practice for knowing who we truly are. It is also the final destination of the process.


And what are we? What is the essence of our selves?


Yoga philosophy provides answers, but - and this is a key point - does not ask us to believe any of them. Instead, it offers us a set of practices and invites us to experiment. Practice, observe, and feel any changes. In this way the yoga approach is very scientific, but while science emphasizes the objective outward experimentation, yoga deals with the subjective inner world. Yoga can lead us to a path of scintillating discoveries and deep understandings, but we will not be able to prove them to outside observers - they would have to embark on their own yoga journey, and find out for themselves.


And what are the possible practices of yoga?


Different practices are appropriate for different people, and there are dozens of different kinds of yoga covering all spheres of life. I will give a few examples from my own life and practice.


I recently spent a month studying at Hridaya yoga, a wonderful yoga school in Mazunte, Oaxaca. The module started with introducing us to the practice of nada yoga.


Nada yoga is the yoga of subtle sounds, the sounds that we hear inside of ourselves. Nada yoga teaches us to identify and resonate with the background sound that permeates everything. Use the sound for entering into deeper layers of ourselves. In Hatha Yoga Pradipika, a key original text on Hatha Yoga, the author says that those who practice Hatha yoga (mostly, postural practice) without nada yoga are simply wasting their time. This is a pretty strong statement, but a key message is that focusing on purely postural practice is not going to take us far on our journey.


In my personal practice I end up blending various kinds of yoga that let me exercise and explore different aspects of myself. For me, as for many others, Hatha yoga, the process of working with and purifying our body via posture and breathing, was the entry point into the world of yoga, and I am still practicing it on a regular basis. I let go and drop into my devotional feeling side via Bhakti yoga, where signing, dancing, and opening my heart to the world is the key practice. I use my mind for inquiring into the nature of existence via the practice of Jnana yoga. And I delight in the subtle dance of polarities of the energy and consciousness in the ubiquitous practice of Tantra yoga.


This is just a sample. The world of yoga is endless.


And the topic of Tantra yoga, or, more generally, Tantra as a spiritual path, will require a separate post.
