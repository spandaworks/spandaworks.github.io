{% include image.html url="empty-space/varanasi.jpg" caption="The Empty Space of Varanasi" %}

Empty space. Space in which nothing happens. Where everything just is. No becoming. Just being.

I spent some time in this space. After months of traveling, participating in workshops and festivals, came the time of integration. The time of resting. The time of non-becoming.

We don't have many opportunities for such a space in our culture. There is so much emphasis on becoming. On growing. On achieving. On reaching from point A to point B.

And yet paradoxically empty space is a most fertile ground for growth. It is yin of resting to yang of creation. It is the sweet nothing of the non-manifest that is preparing to burst into manifestation.

I spent most of my empty time in the holy Indian city of Varanasi. Varanasi is a spiritual vortex, where life and death meet and flow into each other. The burning ghats, the sacred river Ganga, children are playing and running after kites whiles bodies are being thrown on pyres. Varanasi has such intensity that I really did not expect to be empty here. And yet somehow all of the powerful energies yielded and left me in the space of pure being.

And so I am here. In the empty spacetime. Preparing to burst into creation.
